/**
 * Phase 2 lead status workflow hierarchy.
 *
 * Level 1 (pipeline stage):
 *   NEW, CONNECTED, NOT_CONNECTED, LOST
 * Level 2 (Connected):
 *   CALL_BACK, INTERESTED, PROSPECT, WON
 * Level 2 (Not Connected):
 *   RINGING, NOT_REACHABLE, SWITCHED_OFF, VOICEMAIL
 * Level 2 (Lost reasons):
 *   INCOMING_BARD, OUT_OF_SERVICE, NOT_AWARE, NOT_CONTACTABLE,
 *   LOCATION_OUT_OF_SCOPE, LANGUAGE_BARRIER, PRICE_HIGH, JOINED_OTHERS,
 *   NOT_ELIGIBLE, INVALID_NUMBER, TEST_LEAD,
 *   NOT_INTERESTED, REASON_NOT_SHARED, JOB_SEEKER
 *
 * Legacy values (CONTACTED / FOLLOW_UP / COUNSELED / APPLICATION_SUBMITTED)
 * remain in the DB enum for backward compatibility with historical data and
 * automations; new leads use the Phased 2 hierarchy above.
 *
 * Canonical transition rules (Section 3, Phase B/N):
 *   - The DB enum is the ONLY vocabulary for lead status.
 *   - WON / CONVERTED are SYSTEM-ONLY terminal states (reached by admission
 *     enrollment / deal-won); a generic lead status PATCH cannot set them.
 *   - Entering any LOST status persists a loss reason (the status itself is a
 *     taxonomy value; REASON_NOT_SHARED is a first-class persisted reason).
 *   - Entering PROSPECT ensures a Deal record exists (auto-created,
 *     idempotent + concurrency-safe via deals(orgId, leadId) unique).
 *   - Prior lead statuses must be one of the transitions returned by
 *     getAllowedLeadStatuses(); service layer enforces it.
