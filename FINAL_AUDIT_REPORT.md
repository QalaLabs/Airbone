## Executive Verdict

**⚠ Partial compliance - production-capable, GOD-file gaps remain**

| Area | Score |
|------|-------|
| Routes / ★ NEW pages | ✅ Strong |
| Contact / Enrol CTA | ✅ Strong |
| Phase 3–4 course pages (ATPL, Cadet, CAS, Airline, Flying) | ✅ Mostly aligned |
| Homepage SEO + H1 | ⚠ Conflict (client hero override vs GOD H1) |
| CPL / Courses index SEO titles | ❌ Mismatch |
| About page structure | ⚠ Partial |
| Form DEV NOTES (OTP / thank-you / lead flags) | ⚠ Needs verification |
| Pages outside GOD file (legal, dgca, flight-dispatcher, extra blogs) | ℹ Out of GOD scope |

## Conflicts Requiring Stakeholder Decision

1. **Homepage H1** - GOD: Pilot Training Academy… · Client: From Classroom / To Cockpit · **Live = client**
2. **Flying H1** - GOD: Complete Guide for 2026 · Live: Which Path Is Right for You?
3. **CPL total cost** - GOD table ₹55–65L vs form Q1 ~₹80L vs blogs ₹65–75L
4. **Student count** - GOD home meta 2000+ · Live 2,500+
5. **FTO claims** - some pages vs `/dgca-compliance` “not an FTO” (prior Phase 3 flag)
6. **DGCA papers** - 5 vs 6 across pages

---

## Priority Fix List (if aligning to GOD)

### 🔴 High
1. Decide homepage H1 (GOD vs client) - document decision
2. Fix CPL page SEO title to GOD string
3. Fix `/courses` SEO title to GOD string
4. Align homepage meta description to GOD (or update GOD to 2,500+)
5. Verify CPL/Cabin form thank-you + OTP flows

### 🟠 Medium
6. About H1 → GOD wording  
7. Cabin SEO title → GOD Veterans string  
8. Flying H1 decide  
9. Homepage schema add WebSite + BreadcrumbList  
10. Course card prices on `/courses`  
11. About DGCA Approvals / Numbers sections  

### 🟡 Low
12. Contact title exact match  
13. Footer blog link QA  
14. Logo orientation QA  
15. Sync GOD file with client hero decision (v7)

## Decisions Locked (2026-07-23)

## 🔴 SEO Titles - DONE

| Page | New title |
